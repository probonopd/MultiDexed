MultiDexed ist a standalone application and a VST plugin that runs multiple instances of [Dexed](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed) to create the unison effect described [here]().

* Each instance can be slightly detuned
* Each instance can be stereo shifted (panned)

MultiDexed is especially useful in DAWs with a limited number of tracks, such as Ableton Live Lite.

__Currently it is not functional yet. Any help appreciated.__
